# Random-Password-Generator
Python script which randomly generates a password which includes letters (lower case as well as upper case), numbers and symbols. 
This has most likely been done a million times but I thought it would be a creative exercise.


** Update: New and improved code. Now the code is printed out in multiple rows instead of a single long row (wow, impressive right). This update is for those that like to have painstakingly long passwords printed out. You're welcome!
